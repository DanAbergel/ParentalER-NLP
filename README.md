This project investigates whether it is possible to predict individual emotion regulation traits — specifically Reappraisal (ERQ) and Rumination (RRS) — from free-text descriptions written by parents during wartime stress.

The repository includes:
- Data preprocessing pipelines for Hebrew text
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Linguistic and psychological feature extraction
- Baseline models (TF-IDF, Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Transformer-based models (HeBERT, mBERT, Sentence Transformers)
- A multi-task regression architecture predicting ERQ_mean and RRS_mean
- Evaluation metrics: Pearson r, MAE, RMSE, R²
- Model interpretation tools (SHAP, feature importance, key-word analysis)

This project aims to bridge psychological constructs with computational text analysis, providing insights into how language reflects cognitive-emotional traits.
